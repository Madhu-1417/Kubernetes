What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool, means Container’s creation. Deletion, scaling, scaling down, everything managed by kubernetes.   


5 Benefits of using Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a popular open-source system for managing and deploying containerized applications.
Some of the main benefits of using Kubernetes include:
1-	Scalability 
2-	High Availability 
3-	Improve resource utilization 
4-	Easy deployment and update 
5-	Portable across cloud Provided

1. Scalability:
Kubernetes makes it easy to scale applications up or down by adding or removing containers as needed. This allows applications to automatically adjust to changes in demand and ensures that they can handle large volumes of traffic.

2. High availability:
It automatically ensures that applications are highly available by scheduling containers across multiple nodes in a cluster and automatically replacing failed containers. This helps prevent downtime & ensures that applications are always available to users.

3. Improved resource utilization:
Kubernetes automatically schedules containers based on the available resources, which helps to improve resource utilization and reduce waste. This can help reduce costs and improve the efficiency of your applications.

4. Easy deployment & updates:
It makes it easy to deploy & update applications by using a declarative configuration approach. This allows developers to specify the desired state of their applications & it will automatically ensure that the actual state matches the desired state.

5. Portable across cloud providers:
It is portable across different cloud providers, which means that you can use the same tools & processes to manage your applications regardless of where they are deployed. This can make it easier to move applications between cloud providers.
Overall, Kubernetes offers a number of benefits for managing and deploying containerized applications, including scalability, high availability, improved resource utilization, and portability.


Kubernetes Architecture 
It is a opensource container management project, It managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

What is the purpose of kubernetes – 
The purposes of Kubernetes is to host your applications in the form of containers in an automated fashion so that you can easily deploy as many instances of your application
as required and easily enable communication between different service within your applications. So, there are many things involved that work together
to make this possible.
The Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes, which may be physical or virtual, on premise or on cloud, that host applications in the form of containers
